/*
   Package coinbase_api is a Go interface to the CoinBase.com
   API. It may be used to design automated Bitcoin trading
   systems.

   Currently implemented endpoints:
        * get account balance
        * get receive address
        * get exchange rate
        * purchase bitcoins
        * sell bitcoins

   The global variable `ApiKey` is used to store your Coinbase API
   key. If this is empty, attempts to make authenticated requests
   will result in an ErrNotAuthenticated error being returned.
